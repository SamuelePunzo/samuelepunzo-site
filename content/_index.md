        I am a Research Assistant at the [Institute for Logic, Language and Computation (ILLC)](https://www.illc.uva.nl/) at the University of Amsterdam, where I work on **mechanistic interpretability** of transformer models — specifically identifying the internal neural circuits responsible for linguistic disambiguation.

        Previously, at the University of Pisa, I developed **explainable machine learning pipelines** for biomedical applications, including novel biomarker discovery for Multiple Sclerosis using multi-omics data (Microarray & scRNA-seq) and interpretability tools such as SHAP and LIME.

        My research interests span **mechanistic interpretability, explainable AI, NLP, and biomedical applications of machine learning**.
